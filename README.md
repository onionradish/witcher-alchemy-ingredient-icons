mixing by updating the inventory icons for alchemy ingredients. Inventory
icons better show each ingredient's primary and secondary components
(if any), without needing to mouse-over the ingredient. 



INSTALLATION

Copy the extracted "Override" folder into the "Data" folder
of your The Witcher install folder.


UNINSTALLING

Delete the "iit_ingr_*.dds" files from the "Data\Override"
folder in your The Witcher install folder.
