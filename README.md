Witcher Ingredient Icons - v 1.0
================================

Author: onionradish [AT] bitlet.com


Description
-----------
This mod simplifies alchemy ingredient inventory management and potion-
mixing by updating the inventory icons for alchemy ingredients. Inventory
icons better show each ingredient's primary and secondary components
(if any), without needing to mouse-over the ingredient. 

See preview.jpg for screenshot.

and unzip it. Copy the extracted "Override" folder into the "Data" folder
of your The Witcher install folder.


Uninstalling
------------
Delete the "iit_ingr_*.dds" files from the "Data\Override"
folder in your The Witcher install folder.
